- **SQL**: Backend database for storing and managing data for news, weather, advertisements, and other screen components.

## How It Works

1. **Data Integration**:
   - The application fetches data from external sources (news and weather APIs) and integrates it with local SQL databases.
2. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - Each screen component is programmed to update seamlessly in the background, ensuring a current and accurate display.
3. **User Interaction**:
   - Includes an interactive map for easy navigation.
